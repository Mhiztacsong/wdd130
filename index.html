           Hello! My name is Johnson Nsisong Gabriel and i am from Akwa Ibom state, Nigeria. I am a lover of music,
           classical music precisely, and i play the keyboard. I aspire to be a Software developer because i love
           the idea of bringing my imaginations or thoughts to reality, simply creating something. So, i'm grateful
           for this opportunity from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-days Saint and byu-idaho.

        <p>Akwa Ibom state is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria, bordered on the east by Cross River State, on the west by Rivers State and Abia State, and on the south by the Atlantic Ocean. The state takes its name from the Qua Iboe River which bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny. Akwa Ibom was split from Cross River State in 1987 with her capital Uyo and with 31 local government areas.</p>
